## üöÄ Overview

The fa7 project is a Python-based financial analysis tool that extracts key financial metrics from HTML and XML files using BeautifulSoup and lxml. It utilizes the langchain library to create a pandas dataframe agent, which enables the extraction of relevant data points from the parsed files. The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data, including pivot tables and visualization using plotly.
